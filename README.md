This repository showcases multiple approaches to building recommendation systems, including:  Collaborative Filtering – user-based and item-based methods leveraging similarity metrics.  Content-Based Filtering – recommendations based on item features and user preferences.  Hybrid Methods – combining collaborative and content-based techniques to improve accuracy.  The goal of this project is to explore and compare different recommendation strategies, evaluate their performance, and understand their use cases in real-world applications such as e-commerce, media, and healthcare personalization.
